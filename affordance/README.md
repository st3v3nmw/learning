### Affordance

An investigation into interesting programming languages.

#### APL

https://xpqz.github.io/learnapl/intro.html

APL is an array language, and one of the oldest programming languages still in use today, next to FORTRAN, Lisp and COBOL. APL uses its own curious-looking symbols, like ⍎⌽⍕⌈*○≡⍬, rather than reserved words written out in English like most other languages, like C or Python. As a language, APL sits at a very high level of abstraction, making it well suited to ultra-concise formulations of algorithms.

#### Coq

https://coq.inria.fr/

Coq is a formal proof management system. It provides a formal language to write mathematical definitions, executable algorithms and theorems together with an environment for semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs.

#### Dafny

https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny

Dafny is a verification-ready programming language. As you type in your program, Dafny's verifier constantly looks over your shoulder, flags any errors, shows you counterexamples, and congratulates you when your code matches your specifications.

#### Haskell

https://www.haskell.org/

An advanced, purely functional programming language

#### Idris

https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2

Idris is a purely functional programming language with first class types.

#### Kind

https://github.com/Kindelia/Kind

A minimal, efficient and practical programming language that aims to rethink functional programming from the scratch, and make it right. Under the hoods, it is basically Haskell, except without historical mistakes, and with a modern, consistent design. On the surface, it aims to be more practical, and to look more like conventional languages. Kind is statically typed, and its types are so powerful that you can prove mathematical theorems on it.

#### Koka

https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html

A strongly typed functional-style language with effect types and handlers.

#### Lean4

https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/whatIsLean.html

Lean is a functional programming language that makes it easy to write correct and maintainable code. You can also use Lean as an interactive theorem prover.

Lean programming primarily involves defining types and functions. This allows your focus to remain on the problem domain and manipulating its data, rather than the details of programming.

#### Lobster

https://strlen.com/lobster/

Lobster is a programming language that tries to combine the advantages of static typing and compile-time memory management with a very lightweight, friendly and terse syntax, by doing most of the heavy lifting for you.

#### Nim

https://nim-lang.org/

Nim is a statically typed compiled systems programming language. It combines successful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula.

#### OCaml

https://ocaml.org/

OCaml is a general-purpose, industrial-strength programming language with an emphasis on expressiveness and safety.

#### Pony

https://www.ponylang.io/

Pony is an open-source, object-oriented, actor-model, capabilities-secure, high-performance programming language.

#### Racket

https://racket-lang.org/

Lispiness

#### Rust

https://www.rust-lang.org/

#### Skip

http://skiplang.com/

Skip is a general-purpose programming language that tracks side effects to provide caching with reactive invalidation, ergonomic and safe parallelism, and efficient garbage collection. Skip is statically typed and ahead-of-time compiled using LLVM to produce highly optimized executables.

#### Vale

https://vale.dev/

Vale is:
    - Fast: Vale is AOT compiled to LLVM, statically-typed, and uses the new generational references technique for memory safety with speed and flexibility, and will soon have region borrow checking to make it even faster.
    - Safe: It is the safest native language, thanks to generational references and Fearless FFI.
    - Easy: Vale has memory-safe single ownership without garbage collection or a borrow checker, which makes it easy to write safe, fast code.
